# connect4

\*_note: to see this as it was at the end of the interview, please check the `interview-state` branch._

a React-based implementation of the game "connect four".

originally built for a 60 minute interview. i wasn't able to finish it in time, but just barely - the final "check for win" algorithm eluded me, but given a couple more minutes, i feel as though i would have been able to fix the bugs in the algorithm and get the game working beautifully.

built using React and Tailwind
